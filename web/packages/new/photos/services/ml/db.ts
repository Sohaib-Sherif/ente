/**
 * ML DB schema.
 *
 * The "ML" database is made of three object stores:
 *
 * - "file-status": Contains {@link FileStatus} objects, one for each
 *   {@link EnteFile} that the ML subsystem knows about. Periodically (and when
 *   required), this is synced with the list of files that the current client
 *   knows about locally.
 *
 * - "face-index": Contains {@link LocalFaceIndex} objects, either indexed
 *   locally or fetched from remote.
 *
 * - "clip-index": Contains {@link LocalCLIPIndex} objects, either indexed
 *   locally or fetched from remote.
 *
 * All the stores are keyed by {@link fileID}. The "file-status" contains
 * book-keeping about the indexing process (whether or not a file needs
 * indexing, or if there were errors doing so), while the other stores contain
 * the actual indexing results.
 *
 * In tandem, these serve as the underlying storage for the functions exposed by
 * the ML database.
