/**
 * Index file, save the persist the results locally, and put them on remote.
 *
 * [Note: ML indexing does more ML]
 *
 * Nominally, and primarily, indexing a file involves computing its various ML
 * embeddings: faces and CLIP. However, since this is a occasion where we have
 * the original file in memory, it is a great time to also compute other derived
 * data related to the file (instead of re-downloading it again).
 *
 * So this function also does things that are not related to ML and/or indexing:
 *
 * -   Extracting Exif.
 * -   Saving face crops.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * [Note: Transient and permanent indexing failures]
 *
 * We mark indexing for a file as having failed only if there is a good chance
 * that the indexing failed because of some inherent issue with that particular
 * file, and not if there were generic failures (like when trying to save the
 * indexes to remote).
 *
 * When we mark it as failed, then a flag is persisted corresponding to this
 * file in the ML DB so that it won't get reindexed in future runs. This are
 * thus considered as permanent failures.
 *
 * > We might retry these in future versions if we identify reasons for indexing
 * > to fail (it ideally shouldn't) and rectify them.
 *
 * On the other hand, saving the face index to remote might fail for transient
 * issues (network issues, or remote having hiccups). We don't mark a file as
 * failed permanently in such cases, so that it gets retried at some point.
 * These are considered as transient failures.
 *
 * However, it is vary hard to pre-emptively enumerate all possible failure
 * modes, and there is a the possibility of some non-transient failure getting
 * classified as a transient failure and causing the client to try and index the
 * same file again and again, when in fact there is a issue specific to that
 * file which is preventing the index from being saved. What exactly? We don't
 * know, but the possibility exists.
 *
 * To reduce the chances of this happening, we treat HTTP 4xx responses as
 * permanent failures too - there are no known cases where a client retrying a
 * 4xx response would work, and there are expected (but rare) cases where a
 * client might get a non-retriable 4xx (e.g. if the file has over ~700 faces,
 * then remote will return a 413 Request Entity Too Large).
