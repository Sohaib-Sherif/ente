/**
 * Extract Exif and other metadata from the given file.
 *
 * [Note: Exif]
 *
 * Exif is a standard for metadata embedded in photos. Exif tags arise from the
 * TIFF specification but now can be found in other file formats, notably JPG,
 * PNG, AVI, MOV, TIFF-based RAW images (and TIFF itself)
 *
 * The standard uses "Exif" (not "EXIF") to refer to itself. We do the same.
 *
 * Exif is now commonly used as a synedoche for all forms of metadata that gets
 * embedded in a file, and this is also how we use the term. So these functions
 * extract and operate on not just Exif tags, but also XMP (XML metadata
 * embedded in images) and IPTC (another metadat standard) tags.
 *
 * The de facto reference for Exif (in its general form) is exiftool.
 * https://exiftool.org/TagNames
 *
 * The library we use is https://github.com/mattiasw/ExifReader.

/**
 * Parse a date from an Exif date and offset tag combination.
 *
 * @param tags Metadata tags associated with a file.
 *
 * @param dateTag The name of the date tag to use.
 *
 * @param offsetTag The name of the offset tag corresponding to {@link dateTag}.
 *
 * @returns a {@link Date} (UTC epoch milliseconds).
 *
 * [Note: Exif dates]
 *
 * The most important bit we usually wish out of Exif is the date and time when
 * the photo was taken. The Exif specification has the following tags related to
 * photo's date:
 *
 * -   DateTimeOriginal
 * -   DateTimeDigitized (aka "CreateDate")
 * -   DateTime (aka "ModifyDate")
 *
 * DateTimeOriginal is meant to signify best when the original image was taken,
 * and we use it as the photo's creation date whenever it is present. If not, we
 * fallback to DateTimeDigitized or DateTime (in that order).
 *
 * Each of these is a string of the format
 *
 *     YYYY:MM:DD HH:mm:ss
 *
 * where
 *
 *     YYYY  4 digit (zero padded) year
 *     MM    2 digit (zero padded) month, with Jan as 01 and Dec as 12.
 *     DD    2 digit (zero padded) day of the month (1 to 31)
 *     HH    2 digit (zero padded) hours since midnight (00 to 23)
 *     mm    2 digit (zero padded) minutes (00 to 59)
 *     ss    2 digit (zero padded) seconds (00 to 59)
 *
 * These dates are all in the local time of the place where the photo was taken.
 * To convert these to UTC, we also need to know the offset from UTC of that
 * local time. This is provided by the three OffsetTime* tags (one for each of
 * the above):
 *
 * -   OffsetTimeOriginal
 * -   OffsetTimeDigitized
 * -   OffsetTime
 *
 * Each of these is a string of the format
 *
 *     Â±HH:mm
 *
 * denoting the signed hour and minute offset from UTC.
 *
 * Note that these OffsetTime* tags are relatively new additions (prior to
 * smartphones, cameras did not have a good way of knowing their TZ), and most
 * old photos will not have this information. In such cases, we assume that
 * these photos are in the local time where this code is running. This is
 * manifestly going to be incorrect in some cases, but it is a better assumption
 * than assuming UTC, which, while deterministic, is going to incorrect in an
 * overwhelming majority of cases.

    // [Note: Defining "raw" Exif]
    //
    // Our goal is to get a "raw" JSON representing all the Exif data associated
    // with a file. This goal is tricky to achieve for the following reasons:
    //
    // -   While Exif itself is a standard, with a standard set of tags (a
    //     numeric id), in practice vendors can use tags more than what are
    //     currently listed in the standard.
    //
    // -   We're not just interested in Exif tags, but rather at all forms of
    //     metadata (e.g. XMP, IPTC) that can be embedded in a file.
    //
    // By default, the library we use (ExifReader) returns a merged object
    // containing all tags it understands from all forms of metadata that it
    // knows about.
    //
    // This implicit whitelist behaviour can be turned off by specifying the
    // `includeUnknown` flag, but this behaviour acts as a safeguard against us
    // trying to include unbounded amounts of data. e.g. there is an Exif tag
    // for thumbnails, which contains a raw image. We don't want this data to
    // blow up the size of the Exif we extract, so we filter it out. However, if
    // we tell the library to include unknown tags, we might get files with
    // other forms of embedded images.
    //
    // So we keep the default behaviour of returning only the tags that the
    // library knows about. Luckily for us, it returns all the XMP tags even if
    // this flag is specified, and that is one place where we'd like unknown
    // tags so that we can selectively start adding support for them.
    //
    // The other default behaviour, of returning a merged object, is a bit more
    // problematic for our use case, since it loses information. To keep things
    // more deterministic, we use the `expanded` flag which returns all these
    // different forms of metadata separately.
    //
    // Generally for each tag (but not for always), we get an entry with an
    // "id", "value" (e.g. the raw bytes), and a "description" (which is the raw
    // data parsed to a form that is more usable). Technically speaking, the
    // value is the raw data we want, but in some cases, the availability of a
    // pre-parsed description will be convenient too. So we don't prune
    // anything, and keep all three.
    //
    // All this means we end up with a JSON whose exact structure is tied to the
    // library we're using (ExifReader), and even its version (the library
    // reserves the right to change the formatting of the "description" fields
    // in minor version updates).
    //
    // So this is not really "raw" Exif. But with that caveat out of the way,
    // practically this should be raw enough given the tradeoffs mentioned
    // above, and consuming this JSON should be easy enough for arbitrary
    // clients without needing to know about ExifReader specifically.

    // The `includeUnknown` flag does not have any effect on the XMP parser, so

    // object, retaining the raw string is unnecessary.
    //
