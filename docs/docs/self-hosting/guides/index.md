# Guides

If you've figured out how to do something, help others out by adding
walkthroughs, tutorials and other FAQ pages in this directory.

See the sidebar for existing guides. In particular:

- If you're just looking to get started, see installation.

- For various administrative tasks, e.g. increasing the storage quota for user
  on your self-hosted instance, see
  [user management](/self-hosting/administration/users).

- For configuring your S3 buckets to get the object storage to work from your
  mobile device or for fixing an upload errors, see
  [object storage](/self-hosting/administration/object-storage).
