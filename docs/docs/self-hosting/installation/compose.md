description: Running Ente with Docker Compose from source

# Docker Compose

If you wish to run Ente via Docker Compose from source, do the following:

## Requirements

Check out the [requirements](/self-hosting/installation/requirements) page to
get started.

## Step 1: Clone the repository

Clone the repository. Change into the `server/config` directory of the
repository, where the Compose file for running the cluster is present.

Run the following command for the same:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ente-io/ente
cd ente/server/config
```

## Step 2: Populate the configuration file and environment variables

In order to run the cluster, you will have to provide environment variable
values.

Copy the configuration files for modification by the following command inside
`server/config` directory of the repository.

This allows you to modify configuration without having to face hassle while
pulling in latest changes.

```shell
# Inside the cloned repository's directory (usually `ente`)
cd server/config
cp example.env .env
cp example.yaml museum.yaml
```

Change the values present in `.env` file along with `museum.yaml` file
accordingly.

::: tip

Make sure to enter the correct values for the database and object storage.

You should consider generating values for JWT and encryption keys for emails if
you intend to use for long-term needs.

You can do by running the following command inside `ente/server`, assuming you
cloned the repository to `ente`:

```shell
# Change into the ente/server
cd ente/server
# Generate secrets
go run tools/gen-random-keys/main.go
```

:::

## Step 3: Start the cluster

Start the cluster by running the following command:

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

This builds Museum and web applications based on the Dockerfile and starts the
containers needed for Ente.

for further usage.
